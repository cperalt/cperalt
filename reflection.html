      <h1>Professional Development</h1>
      <p>
        The professional development component of the gateway served as a refresher of the importance
        of professionalism in the workplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a realization, I identified one of my strengths to be effective communication. Throughout
        the gateway, I was effective in relaying information pertaining to questions and concerns
        regarding the canvas course through email. I used a confident and natural tone while maintaining
        proper email etiquette.

      <h1>Technical Section</h1>
      <p>
        The technical aspects of programming for me primarily come down to two things: being resourceful
        enough to find the solutions and a trial-and-error mindset. Majority of the problems I ran into
        were found with a quick internet search or finding a similar code snippet online. I have come to
        realize the importance of adaptability and flexibility. I was able to progress and advance my
        learning by utilizing code examples found online and making them work in my favor. Much of this
        method involved trial-and-error, playing around with code and testing what worked and did not
        work. Here I emphasize Technical Program Manager Justin McNeil’s words, “Practice makes progress.”

      <h1>Personal Section</h1>
      <p>
        On a personal level, I have realized the importance of having mentors and being able to rely on
        others. I really enjoyed attending office hours and having actual interactions with fellow
        applicants and instructors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very proud about my current level of understanding and progress. I feel like I have advanced
        so much within a short time frame. Although the learning content on the gateway canvas course has
        felt slow due to its introductory nature, I took the liberty to advance my learning through
        external resources, being the source of my learning. What I have realized as I started to code
        and has helped my advancement, is that I am genuinely interested, enjoying, and having lots of fun.
